## 🔎 Introduction
In this assignment, I explored **Kali Linux tools** for two phases of penetration testing:  
- **Reconnaissance** (information gathering)  
- **Maintaining Access** (persistence after exploitation)  

Each tool was tested with at least **three features**, and screenshots were taken to demonstrate usage. Sensitive information such as IP addresses and domains has been blacked out.
