## 🔎 Introduction
In this assignment, I explored **Kali Linux tools** for two phases of penetration testing:  
- **Reconnaissance** (information gathering)  
- **Maintaining Access** (persistence after exploitation)  

Each tool was tested with at least **three features**, and screenshots were taken to demonstrate usage. Sensitive information such as IP addresses and domains has been blacked out.

## 📊 Comparison & Conclusions
- **Reconnaissance tools** focus on **information gathering** (ports, services, DNS records).  
- **Maintaining access tools** focus on **persistence and stealth** (backdoors, tunneling, encrypted communication).  
- Recon-ng and Nmap are more structured and widely used for scanning, while tools like Weevely and Cryptcat are lightweight but effective for persistence.  
- Overall, combining reconnaissance and persistence tools provides a **complete penetration testing workflow**.
